# Memory Game 

## Instructions

Welcome to the Memory Game! 

The game begins with 16 hidden cards. Your job is to click on a card, note the icons that the card reveals, and quickly find its matching pair before the cards flip over, again. Once you've found a matching pair, the cards will change colors and remain displayed on the screen. 

The timer begins once the game loads, and your score is effected by the number of moves you make. To reset the timer, press the refresh button. After you've successfully matched all 16 cards, you've won the game! Want to play again? Click the "YES" button. 

Good luck!
